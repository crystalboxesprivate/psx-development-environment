  so on your own responsibility.

  was displayed at compile time.  This problem has been fixed.
  (INT_MIN,UINT_MAX,LONG_MIN, ULONG_MAX)


Standard C Library (libc/libc2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Library Bug Fix >
- With bcmp(), memcmp(), if the comparing size is 0, the return value
  was occasionally not 0.  This problem has been fixed.

- With strtol(), strtoul(), if NULL is passed to the second argument,
  the contents of the addres 0 was destroyed.  
  This problem has been fixed.


Extended CD-ROM Library (libds)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Library Bug Fix >
- After the execution of DsClose(), if executing DsInit() again,
  DsSearchFile() was incapable of exchanging discs.  This problem has
  been fixed.

- When making disc access with DsControl(), DsCommand() and DsPacket(),
  it was possible not to detect the termination of commands depending
  on the operation timing.  This problem has been fixed.


Basic Graphics Library (libgpu)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Library Bug Fix >
- When multiple streams were opened with FntOpen() and the maximum 
  number of characters are then displayed with FntPrint(), the other
  stream buffer was occasionaly destroyed because of this and FntPrint()
  was not operated properly.  This problem has been fixed.


Extended Graphics Library (libgs)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Library Bug Fix >
- When performing automatic division in GsA4divNG3() and GsA4divNG4(),
  it was not correctly drawn translucent.  This problem has been fixed.

- When performing automatic division in GsA4divTNF3(), GsA4divTNG3(), 
  GsA4divTNF4() and GsA4divTNG4(), it was drawn with shading off scheme. 
  This problem has been fixed.

- When performing automatic division in GsA4divNF3(), GsA4divNF4(),
  GsA4divG3L(), GsA4divG3LFG(), GsA4divG3NL(), GsA4divG4L(), 
  GsA4divG4LFG() and GsA4divG4NL(), the gap beteween
  the divided polygons were padded with the opaque polygons.  Those 
  polygons were replaced with the translucent ones to reflect the code 
  of the tmd data.


Controller Library (libpad)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Library Bug Fix >
- The V-BLANK interrupt which is an operation to communicate with the
  controller did not return.  This problem has been fixed.

- Although the above interrupt operation was returned, it was 
  occasionally blocked inside for the period of relatively long time.
  * These two symptoms can occur in both PadInitDirect and PadInitMtap.

- By the time it recognizes the controller with actuator (such as 
  DUALSHOCK) from the communication error state, the null pointer access
  was made.  This problem has been fixed.
